Selenium Class 6:
 Alerts:
 Alerts is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focusof our main page that we are working on
 We cannot proceed until it is handled

    3 Types of Alerts:
 1. Web based alerts/html alert -we can simply inspect and perform need actions
 2. Java script alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                         we cannot inspect
 3.Windows based alerts-we cannot handle with Selenium or Cancel

 Types of Java script Alerts
 1.Simple alert --> click ok
 2.Confirmation alert --> either cancel or click ok
 3.Prompt alert -->  enter the text ent ten click ok (or cancel don't have to wright tex)

 To handle Java Script alerts we have 4 methods:
 1. accept() --> click ok
 2. dismiss() --> click cancel
 3.getText()
 4.sendKeys()

 To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in th URL
  public static  String url= "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                   //username:password@

   Frames:
   Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
   Frames allowed developers represent multiple views on one page

   3 Ways to interact with Frames
   1.By index
   2.bu name ro id
   3WebElement
   in alerts -switch to alert and switch automatically back
   in flames -switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the web page
