Selenium Class 7

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
In order for us to handle a multiple window we will be using:
getWindowHandle();
getWindowHandles();

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that holds the address of the windows or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID


Synchronization:
is the process of bringing the speed of two or nore components the same level
in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the speed level

Thread.sleep() --static wait / unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait

Implicit wait:
it tells the web-driver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
We can stay that Implicit wait is a global wait

Implicit wait works with findElement() method

Implicit wait is usualy set to 20 sec.If your element is any time between the given time the remaining
time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action

If element is not found in a given time,ONLY then you will get an execution
